# Univariate Time Series Algorithms

### **Autoregressive (AR) Model**
- **Purpose**: Models the current value of the series as a linear combination of its previous values.
- **Usage**: Effective for time series with autocorrelation, where past values influence future values.

### **Moving Average (MA) Model**
- **Purpose**: Models the current value as a linear function of past forecast errors.
- **Usage**: Useful for capturing the impact of past forecast errors on current values.

### **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model**
- **Purpose**: Combines AR and MA models to account for both past values and past forecast errors.
- **Usage**: Suitable for stationary time series where both autoregressive and moving average components are needed.

### **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**
- **Purpose**: Extends ARMA to include differencing to make the series stationary.
- **Usage**: Ideal for non-stationary time series that require differencing to achieve stationarity.

### **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Model**
- **Purpose**: Extends ARIMA to handle seasonal effects.
- **Usage**: Suitable for time series with seasonal patterns, adding seasonal components to the ARIMA model.

### **State Space Models**
- **Purpose**: Uses state-space representation to model time series, including the Kalman filter for estimation.
- **Usage**: Provides a flexible framework for modeling time series with various underlying states and transitions.

### **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (ARIMAX) Model**
- **Purpose**: Extends ARIMA to include exogenous variables (external regressors).
- **Usage**: Useful for incorporating external factors that affect the time series.

### **Seasonal ARIMAX (SARIMAX) Model**
- **Purpose**: Extends SARIMAX to include exogenous variables.
- **Usage**: Combines seasonal ARIMA with external regressors for forecasting with seasonal patterns and additional influencing factors.

### **Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS)**
- **Purpose**: A class of state space models that includes exponential smoothing methods with components for error, trend, and seasonality.
- **Types**:
  - **ETS(A,A,A)**: Additive error, additive trend, additive seasonality
  - **ETS(M,A,A)**: Multiplicative error, additive trend, additive seasonality
  - **ETS(A,M,A)**: Additive error, multiplicative trend, additive seasonality
  - **ETS(A,A,M)**: Additive error, additive trend, multiplicative seasonality

### **Exponential Smoothing Methods (ESM)**
- **Purpose**: A family of forecasting techniques that apply weighted averages to historical data, with more weight given to more recent observations.
- **Usage**: Adapt quickly to changes in data and provide forecasts that are updated as new observations become available.

### **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)**
- **Purpose**: Best suited for series without trends or seasonality. It smooths the data with a single smoothing parameter.
- **Usage**: Ideal for series where only recent observations are relevant for forecasting.

### **Holtâ€™s Linear Trend Method**
- **Purpose**: Extends SES by adding a component to handle linear trends in the data.
- **Usage**: Useful for time series with a linear trend component.

### **Holt-Winters Seasonal Method**
- **Purpose**: Further extends Holt's method by incorporating a seasonal component, making it suitable for data with both trend and seasonality.
- **Usage**: Best for time series with both trend and seasonal patterns.

### **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**
- **Purpose**: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction problems.
- **Usage**: Effective for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.

### **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**
- **Purpose**: Another RNN variant, similar to LSTM but with a different gating mechanism.
- **Usage**: Suitable for sequence prediction tasks, often providing faster training and similar performance to LSTM.

### **Prophet**
- **Purpose**: Developed by Facebook, this model handles seasonality and holidays and is robust to missing data.
- **Usage**: Ideal for time series with strong seasonal effects and additional holidays, providing flexible and interpretable forecasts.
