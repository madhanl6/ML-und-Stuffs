# Supervised Learning

The supervised learning process involves several steps to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. Below is a step-by-step guide:

## 1. Define the Problem

- Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve.
- Determine whether it's a classification, regression, or another type of supervised learning task.

## 2. Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Values**: Address missing data through imputation or removal.
- **Changing Datatypes**: Ensure all data types are appropriate for analysis and modeling.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identify and eliminate duplicate records.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Outlier Detection

- **EDA**: Analyze data distributions, relationships, and patterns.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and investigate outliers in the dataset.

## 4. Data Cleaning (Handling Outliers)

- **Handling Outliers**: Address outliers identified during EDA, either by transformation, removal, or other techniques.
- **Other miscellaneous cleaning**

## 5. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection

- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify and select the most relevant features for the model.

## 6. Save Cleaned Data

- **Save**: Store the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for use in modeling.

## 7. Encode Categorical Features/Labels

- **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## 8. Train-Test Split (Also Train-Validation Split)

- **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Train-Validation Split**: Optionally, split the training data further into training and validation subsets for model tuning.

## 9. Handling Imbalance

- **Imbalance Handling**: Address class imbalance using techniques such as resampling, class weighting, or synthetic data generation.

## 10. Normalize/Standardize

- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale features to ensure they contribute equally to the model training.

## 11. Build the Model

- **Model Building**: Develop the machine learning model using the selected features and training data.

## 12. Cross-Validation

- **Cross-Validation**: Assess model performance using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.

## 13. Evaluation

- **Evaluation**: Assess the model using performance metrics relevant to the problem (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for classification; MSE, RMSE for regression).

## 14. Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to improve performance using techniques like grid search or random search.

## 15. Explainability

- **Explainability**: Interpret and explain the model's predictions and features' importance to understand its behavior and ensure transparency.

## 16. Deployment

- **Backend**: Set up the server and infrastructure for the model.
- **API**: Develop an API to allow interaction with the model.
- **Frontend**: Create a user interface to present results and facilitate user interaction.

## 17. Monitoring

- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance and system stability in production.

## 18. Retrain When the Model Degrades or with New Data

- **Retraining**: Update the model periodically with new data or when performance degrades to maintain accuracy and relevance.

## 19. Continue to CI/CD

- **CI/CD**: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices for automated testing, integration, and deployment of the model.

# Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the dataset is analyzed without predefined labels or outcomes. Although there is no explicit train-test split, the process typically involves similar steps.
